    <p>
      Pocket Empires is a engine that allows you to run many different types of scenarios.
      Each of these scenarios is a game.
      One of the first things you do when you play is pick the game you wish to play.
      Different games have different parameters and are suited to different styles of play.
      You can even make your own games or modify existing games.

    <h2>Name and Author</h2>
    <p>
      People are welcome to create their own Pocket Empire scenarios.
      As interesting scenarios are developed they will be incorporated into the core release
      of the game.
      In order to give credit where credit is due, we include the name and contact for
      the author of a game.

    <a name="Turns"></a>
    <h2>Turns and Phases</h2>
    <p>
      A game consists of a series of turns.
      How long, exactly, a game is depends on the scenario.      
      Each turn in the game progresses through a number of phases (and sub-phases).
      After the last phase of the last turn the game is over.
      Final scores are displayed and you can peruse how well the other sides did.
      The general format for each turn is as follows:
      <li><a href="#SetupPhase">Setup Phase</a></li>
      <li><a href="#MovementPhase">Movement Phase</a></li>
      <li><a href="#CombatPhase">Combat Phase</a>

    <a name="SetupPhase"></a>
    <h2>Setup Phase</h2>
    <p>
      During the setup phase you decide where to place your ships.
      Depending on the scenario you may start with a alrge number or a small number of worlds.
      If you start with just one, then all ships may start being set up on that world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some scenarios allow for you to change your mind about the makeup of the fleet.
      In these cases you can pick ships from the preset fleet and scrap them.
      This increases the resources you have.
      You can then design replacement ships up to the value of the created resources.
      These can then be deployed normally.
    </p>
    <a name="MovementPhase"></a>
    <h2>Movement Phase</h2>
    <p>
      The movement phase is where you can determine where to deploy your ships too.
      It takes a full week to jump from one star system to the next.
      For simplicity of play it is assumed that all ships move at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ships have no jump drive.
      You cannot move these from system to system on their own.
      They may, however, be carried in other ships.
      When you move the carrier, all contained ships are automatically moved as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving takes a certain amount of fuel.
      If your ships does not have enough fuel, then it cannot move.
      You can transfer fuel between ships if you need it.
      Or the ship can be carried as if it had no jump drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can move into an empty hex.
      There is no world or fuel available there.
      But for ships with limited jump drives (but extra fuel space) it can be
      a convienent way to reach systems you could not otherwise reach.
    </p>
    <a name="CombatPhase"></a>
    <h2>Combat Phase</h2>
    <p>
      Combat occurs whenever ships belonging to two (or more) sides occupy the same system.
      (Combat cannot occur in empty hexes.)
      Combat is announced when it happens.
      There is a <a href="FleeingPhase">Fleeing Phase</a>, 
      followed by as many <a href="TargetPhase">Targetting Phases</a> as necessary to 
      resolve the combat.
      At the conclusion the ownership of the system is re-evaluated.
    </p>
    <a name="FleeingPhase"></a>
    <h2>Ship Fleeing Phase</h2>
    <p>
      The first things that happens is that each side is given a chance to flee
      non-combatant ships (for example, carriers).
      Often, if the combatants do not like the odds once they get to a system,
      all ships end up fleeing and no combat occurs.
      Ships who flee combat may be unable to refuel.
      If they flee, the play no part in determining ownership of the system at
      the end of the combat phase.
    </p>
    <a name="TargetPhase"></a>
    <h2>Target Determination Phase</h2>
    <p>
      For each round of combat ships pick their targets.
      A ship may decide that discretion is the better part of valor and attempt to flee.
      But if a ships chooses to flee during a targeting phase they will be subject to
      one round of attacks before they make it to the outer system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once all sides have picked their targets, that round of combat occurs and the results
      are reported.
      Attacks may hit or miss.
      Ships may be damaged or destroyed.
      Combat finishes once there are active ships belonging to one side only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once combat has finished, the ownership of the world is re-determined.
      By default the own of the world is whatever side had active ships remaining at the end of combat.
      However in some scenarios worlds have intrinsic defense.
      In this case there must be that many attack factors of ships present in order for the world
      to switch sides.
      Note, if all ships flee combat there will be no change in ownership.
      In some scenarios neutral worlds cannot be converted.
    </p>
    <a name="RepairPhase"></a>
    <h2>Repair Phase</h2>
    <p>
      During the repair phase ships are surveyed and qualifying ones may be repaired.
      Only ships that have no moved or targeted another ship in combat may be repaired.
      The number of ships that can be repaired by a world depends on the starport type.
      Damaged ships that are repaired become fully operational again.
    </p>
    <a name="ConstructionPhase"></a>
    <h2>Construction Phase</h2>
    <p>
      During this phase all of the worlds in the game are visited and assessed for production
      if they have ships in their build queue.
      Construction work is done on the ship subject to resources being available, and the
      world's production value.
      If production is completed, the ship is made available in the system and production
      moves on to the next ship (if any) in the build queue.
    </p>
    <a name="VP"></a>
    <h2>Victory Points</h2>
    <p>
      Over the course of the game victory points are decided. 
      At the very end of the game these are used to determine the winner.
      Victory points are based on different things depending on the scenario.
      Some scenarios are about grabbing worlds, others are about building
      (and surviving) with fleets.
      Formulas describe how points are calculated.
      For example, a common formula used to determine victory points in a
      world grabbing game would be &quot;Port*Pop&quot;.
      This means the value of a world is the value of its starport (where
      A = 5, B = 4, etc) times the Population digit of the world.
      A common formula used to determine victory points in a
      ship building game would be &quot;Attack+Defense&quot;.
      This means the value of a ships is the combined total of its
      attack and defense factors.
