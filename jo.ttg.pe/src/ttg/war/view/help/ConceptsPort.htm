    <h1>Starport Concepts</h1>
    <p>
      Not all scenarios have starship production enabled.
      But for those that do, a world with a starport of A or B can build starships.

    </ul>
    <a name="ConstructionRate"></a>
    <h2>Construction Rate</h2>
    <p>
      The rate at which a starport can construct ships is set by a formula in the scenario.
      It its measured against the cost of the starship.
      For comparison purposes with the normal starship rules you can consider it to be "tons".
      It requires one unit of resources for each unit of product to build one unit of cost of starship.
      So unless your production is high enough you will not necessarily be able to build at the
      full rate for each starport.

    <a name="Build Queue"></a>
    <h2>Build Queue</h2>
    <p>
      You can queue up multiple starship to be built.
      You can add, remove and modify starships in your queue.
      However, if you change the design of a starship that is already under construction,
      the entire ship is lost and all the resources that went into making it.
      Similarly, if a world changes sides, all production is scrapped.
