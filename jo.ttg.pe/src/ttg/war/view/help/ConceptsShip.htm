    <h1>Ship Concepts</h1>
    <p>
      Starship are the weapon with which the wars in Pocket Empires are fought.
      There are rather a large variety of ships.
      They are typically classed into battleships, battle riders, carriers,
      system defense boats, scouts and fights.
      But these are just semantic differences; ways of interpreting different
      design strategies.

    <h2>Attack Factors</h2>
    <p>
      This is how strong your ship is at attacking.
      It is an abstract representation of the offensive armament of the ship.
      When combat occurs, the attack factors of all the attacking ships are added
      up to determine the odds of the attack.
    </p>
    <a name="DefenseFactors"></a>
    <h2>Defense Factors</h2>
    <p>
      This is how strong your ship is at defense.
      It is an abstract representation of the maneuverability and armour of the ship.
      When combat occurs, the defense factor of the defendings ship is compared with
      the attack factors of the attacking ships
      to determine the odds of the attack.
    </p>
    <a name="Jump"></a>
    <h2>Jump</h2>
    <p>
      The jump rating says how many parsecs (hexes) a ship may jump in a single turn.
      Multiple jumps may be made if the ship has sufficient fuel, but no jump larger than
      the jump rating may be made at any one time.
    </p>
    <a name="Capacity"></a>
    <h2>Capacity</h2>
    <p>
      Capacity is the amount of storage space a ship has.
      This space can be used for either fuel storage, or for carrying other craft.
      Typically extra fuel space is alloted to give ships with a lower jump rating further (although slower)
      range.
      Extra hanger space is used to carry ships with no jump from system to system or to
      store fighters to add to a ships capabilities.
      Capacity is measured in the same arbitrary units as size.
      For comparison purposes one unit can be considered one ton of starship.
    </p>
    <a name="Size"></a>
    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p>
      The size of your ship depends on its Attack, Defense, Jump and Capacity ratings.
      Each Attack or Defense factor is 100 units in size.
      Capacity is the rated units in size.
      Although in the designer capacity is often described as the amout of hanger
      space or number of jump-1 fuel amounts.
      The jump drive is different. 
      It takes up a varying amount, partially dependent on
      the size of the rest of the ship.
      The formula is 1% + 11% per jump rating.
      This includes the 10% per jump range required for fuel.
      I.e. your jump drive automatically contains enough fuel for one
      jump at its maximum range.
      Additional fuel space make be allocated under capacity.
    </p>
    <a name="Cost"></a>
    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <p>
      The cost of the ship is in arbitrary units.
      For simplicty this is equal to the size of the ship minus the capacity.
      I.e. you don't pay for hanger space.
      You do, however, pay for the basic range worth of fuel space! 
      This is the reflect the high cost of the jump drives themselves, even though
      they take a small amount of space.
