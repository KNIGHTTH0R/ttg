           During each round of combat you need to decide which ships are attacking
           which enemy ships.
           At the top of the panel is the name of the system you are at and its icon.
           Next is listed the round of combat that is happening.
           Beneath this is a <a href="PanelShips.htm">Ship Panel</a> containing your
           ships in the system.
           Next down is a <a href="PanelShips.htm">Ship Panel</a> containing the
           enemy ships.
           You can select one or more ships from that your panel, select one ship
           form the enemy panel, and click "Target" to assign those ships to
           attack that ship.
           The "odds" field will update with the attack odds against that ship.
         </p>
         <p>
           Odds translate into the attack having a chance of hitting as follows:
           <table BORDER CELLSPACING='0' CELLPADDING='3'>
             <tr><td>Odds</td><td>Hit on 2D</td><td>%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>6:1</td><td> 2+</td><td>100%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>5:1</td><td> 3+</td><td> 97%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>4:1</td><td> 4+</td><td> 92%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>3:1</td><td> 5+</td><td> 83%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>2:1</td><td> 6+</td><td> 75%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>3:2</td><td> 7+</td><td> 58%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>1:1</td><td> 8+</td><td> 42%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>2:3</td><td> 9+</td><td> 28%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>1:2</td><td>10+</td><td> 17%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>1:3</td><td>11+</td><td>8%</td></tr>
             <tr><td>1:4</td><td>12+</td><td>3%</td></tr>
           </table>
         </p>
         <p>
           Instead of attack you can choose to mark a ship as fleeing.
           This will not participate in combat but try to flee into the outer system.
           However during that round it is still subject to attack by the enemy ships!
         </p>
         <p>
           At any point you can click "Reset" to unmark all ships.
         </p>
         <p>
           When you have assigned all ships to targets or fleeing you can click the "Done" button
           and the computer will resolve the attacks.
