           The Game Information Panel gives you information on the standing of the

            The top gives the name of the current scenario and then how far you
            have currently progressed through the game.

            There is an Empire Panel listing the sides.
            Selecting a side in this panel will display some summary information on the side.
            Double clicking a side will change the information panel to display all the details
            on that side.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a side is selected, the current number of victory points, the total population,
            and the fleet strength is shown beneath the Empire Panel.
            At the very bottom you can click on the Scenario Information button to call up information
            on the scenario design.
