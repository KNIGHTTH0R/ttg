      You can create new scenarios for use with Pocket Empires. 
      Please add a link below and create a page (following the naming convention), 
      and paste in your scenario.
      To run someone's scenario, click "Add Custom" from the game selection dialog.
      Cut and paste in the text from the scenario page to the dialog and click "OK" to load

    <p><b>General</b></p>
    <p>
      A PocketEmpires scenario is a text file with directives on how a 
      particular scenario works.
      Lines beginning with # are considered comments and ignores.
      Actually, anything it doesn't recognize is ignored.
      Significant lines are in the form of:
    </p>
    <pre>
      key = value
    </pre>
    <p>
      With any amount of white space around the = sign.
      Some keys may appear more than once and add a new element
      of the type they represent (e.g. Side1Ship).
      Other keys should only appear once, as subsequent appearances override
      the value previously set (e.g. Name).
      Keys are case insensitive.
