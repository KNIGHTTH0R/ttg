    <h1>Side Concepts</h1>
    <p>
      A scenario in Pocket Empires will have one or more sides.
      These represent opposing factions in the conflict.
      When you chose a scenario to play you will pick which side
      you play.
      The computer will play the remaining sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the time a variety of options will be presented for each side.
      Because of geography and variance of fleets no two sides will be
      exactly equal.
      Some will be easier to play than others.
      This allows you to play the game multiple times.
      Each time you can choose a harder side to play and increase the challange
      for you.

    <h2>Name and Arms</h2>
    <p>
      Each side has a name.
      This is what it will be listed as when sides are compared.
      Each side also has a coat of arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to being a pretty iconographic device for recognizing sides,
      the coat of arms also gives a unique color combination for a side.
      This color combination is used elsewhere to mark territory, ships,
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <a name="Resources"></a>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Resources represent accumulated processed goods.
      In a scenario where shipbuilding is enabled you can assemble these
      resources into new ships for your fleet.
      Each world produces resources at a particular rate.
      Rather than complexify things by setting up trade routes and
      building a merchant marine force, the transport and delivery of
      resources is abstracted.
      All resources produced are available for use throughout your pocket
      empire.
      So we only present the total resources available, and not how much
      is accumulated on each world.
    </p>
    <a name="Production"></a>
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>
      The production figure for a side is the total amount of resources
      that are produced <i>each turn</i>.
      If unused, these will accumulate in the <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>
      value.
    </p>
    <a name="MaxTech"></a>
    <h2>Maximum Technology Level</h2>
    <p>
      The maximum technology value for your pocket empire is the value
      at the highest tech world.
      This is important for ship construction.
      The higher tech a pocket empire has the longer range jump drives
      that can be build.
    </p>
    <a name="FleetStrength"></a>
    <h2>Fleet Strength</h2>
    <p>
      For easy comparison you can look at the cumulative fleet strength
      for a side.
      This is given in terms of the total attack factors, total defense factors
      and total cost of the ships in the fleet.
    </p>
    <a name="VP"></a>
    <h2>Victory Points</h2>
    <p>
      According to the formulas set in the scenario, each side will accrue
      Victory Points.
      These are used in the end of the game to determine the winner.
