    <h1>Scenario Victory Points</h1>
    <p>
      This group of keys define how the game is scored.
      Each of these settings is an equasion that is used to calculate
      victory points at certain times.
      Most mathematical expressions are accepted.
      Variables can be used in these expressions pertaining either to 
      worlds or ships.
      Different variables are available for each time and are contained
      in tables at the end of this page.
      There are two general reccomended modes of distributing victory points.
      Both can be used to achieve the same ends, but in different ways.
      Or combined in some interesting method of calucation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mode one: <i>posession</i>.
      Set the values of either or both VPHave keys.
      Victory Points are then measured based on what someone currently has
      or posesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mode two: <i>aquisition</i>.
      Set the values of either or both VPGain and VPLose keys.
      Victory Points are then measured based on what someone gains or loses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPHaveWorld</b>
      This specifies the victory points for having a world.
      When a world changes ownership this value is removed from the
      lower and awarded to the winner.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPGainWorld</b>
      This specifies the victory points for gaining a world.
      When a world changes ownership this value is awarded to the winner.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPLoseWorld</b>
      This specifies the victory points for losing a world.
      When a world changes ownership this value is removed from the loser.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPHaveShip</b>
      This specifies the victory points for having a ship.
      They are assessed at the begining of the game. Each time
      a ship is lost this value is removed from the loser.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPGainShip</b>
      This specifies the victory points for gaining a ship.
      If the game supports ship construction, this value is awarded
      anyone who makes a ship.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>VPLoseShip</b>
      This specifies the victory points for losing a ship.
      When a ship is destroyed in combat, this value is removed from the loser.
      It should only appear once.
