    <h1>Side Definition Keys</h1>
    <p>
      These keys are used to define the values for each side.
      They all start with 'Side' and a number for that side, followed by
      the rest of that key.
      Below we will use Side1, but it is equally applicable for Side2, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Side1Name</b>
      This is the name of the side.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Side1VP</b>
      This is a starting value to a side's Victory Points.
      It can be used to round off values so each side starts with the same.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Side1Resources</b>
      This is the amount of initial resources this side starts with.
      Resources are used in ship building.
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Side1WorldURI</b>
      This key declares territory that belongs to this side at
      the start of the game.
      This key is in <b>TtgUriFormat</b>.
      You can use a world or ord URI to specify a single world
      You can use a sector or subsector URI to specify a whole area.
      This key can be repeated. Each addition adds more territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Side1Ship</b>
      This key adds a ship to that side.
      The value for this key is in the format:
      <pre>
        Side1Ship = 'name','att','def','cap','jump'
        Side1Ship = 'name','att','def','cap','jump',x'num'
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where 'name" is the name of the ship, 'att' is the attack factors,
      'def' is the defense factors, and 'jump' is the jump range in
      parsecs (hexes).
    </p>
    <p>
      'cap' can be of the form '#.#' or '#' or '.#'. 
      The first number says how many factors of capacity the ship can contain.
      For example, specifying a capacity of '2' would create a hanger
      large enough for a '1.1.0' fighter.
      The second number says how many extra jump-1 amounts of fuel should
      be stored.
      For example, specifying a capacity of '.1' would create an extra
      fuel tank with enough space to jump this ship an extra 1 parsec.
    </p>
    <p>
      'num' is an optional prameter to indicate the number of these ships
      to add to this side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: in actual play there is no distinction made between hanger capacity
      and fuel capacity. Nothing prevents you putting fuel into your hanger space
      or ships into your fuel space (although not both at once!).
      This is given as a convienence here in ship design.
    </p>
    <p>
      This key can be repeated. Each addition adds another ship.
