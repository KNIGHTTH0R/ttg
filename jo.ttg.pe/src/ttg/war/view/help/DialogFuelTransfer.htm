    <p>
      Occasionally you may have need to transfer fuel between ships.
      One might be a fuel tender and the other passing through its depot.
      Or one ship might be on a rescue mission to save a ship stranded in a
      empty or hostile hex.

      To call up the fuel transfer dialog select two ships in the same location
      from a Ship Panel. Then click the fuel transfer button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fuel transfer dialog displays the two ships side by side.
      Many of the details are show.
      The most relevant for the fuel transfer are the Jump range, Fuel tankage,
      and the fuel required for a Jump-1.
      At the bottom are several buttons to handle the fuel transfer.

      This button transfers all of the fuel in the ship to the right to the left.
    </p>

      <img src="DialogFuelTransferLL.gif">
      This button transfers just enough fuel from the ship on the right to give the
      ship on the left a single jump unit in range.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="DialogFuelTransferL.gif">
      This button transfers a single ton of fuel in the ship to the right to the left.

      This button transfers all of the fuel in the ship to the left to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all circumstances it will never transfer more fuel than a ship contains
      or can store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking the done button closes the dialog and ends the fuel transfer.
