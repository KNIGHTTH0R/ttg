    <h1>World Concepts</h1>
    <p>
      Worlds are the geography of Pocket Empires.
      They are fought over and owned by the fighting fleets.
      Ultimately, in most scenarios, ownership determines the winning side.

    <h2>Universal Planetary Profile</h2>
    <p>
      The Imperial Scouts use a standard one line planet/system description 
      called the Universal Planetary Profile (UPP for short) to code the 
      qualities and characteristics of worlds. 
      The UPP consists of single letters or digits to indicate starport 
      or <a href="#Starport">spaceport</a>, six basic characteristics 
      (<a href="#Size">size</a>, 
      <a href="#Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, 
      <a href="#Hydrosphere">hydrographics</a>, 
      <a href="#Population">population</a>, 
      <a href="#Government">government</a>, 
      and <a href="#Law">law level</a>), 
      and a <a href="#Technology">technological index</a>.      
    </p>
    <a name="Side"></a>
    <h2>Side</h2>
    <p>
      Each world is either neutral, or belongs to a side.
      In some scenarios neutral worlds remain neutral.
      In others, they can be conquered.
      In all games worlds owned by one side can be conquered by another side.
      The owning side gains the benefits of being able to refuel there,
      build ships there, and gain the resources produced there.
    </p>
    <a name="IntrinsicDefense"></a>
    <h2>Intrinsic Defense</h2>
    <p>
      In some scenarios worlds are considered to have in intrinsic defense
      over and above any defensive factors of guarding ships.
      This value is equals to the <a href="#Population">population</a>.
      An occupying force needs to have at least that many defensive factors
      present in the system at the conclusion of battle to overcome the
      intrinsic defense and gain ownership of the world.
    </p>
    <a name="Fuel Points"></a>
    <h2>Fuel Points</h2>
    <p>
      Starships burn hydrogen in their jump drive to travel between starsystems.
      They can refuel either by scooping fuel from gas giants in the system or
      by refining the water in oceans of the main world.
      If a system is adequately defended, ships that don't belong to the owner
      of the system cannot refuel at that point.
      The defense required is four defensive factors per fuel point in the system.
      This is over and above any <a href="#IntrinsicDefense">intrinsic defense</a>
      in the system.
    </p>
    <a name="Repairs"></a>
    <h2>Repairs</h2>
    <p>
	  Starports can repair ships as follows:
      <table border='1'>
        <tr><th>Port</th><th>Can Repair</th></tr>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>Two per turn</td></tr>
        <tr><td>B</td><td>One per turn</td></tr>
        <tr><td>C</td><td>Two per game</td></tr>
        <tr><td>D</td><td>One per game</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <a name="ResourceGeneration"></a>
    <h2>Resource Generation</h2>
    <p>
      Each world can generate resources that accumulate for the owning side.
      The amount of resources generated depends on the scenario.
      The default formula for resource generation is Pop*Port*2.
    </p>
    <a name="VP"></a>
    <h2>Victory Points</h2>
    <p>
      According to formulas set in the scenario worlds can be worth a
      number of Victory Points.
      These are used in the end of the game to determine the winner.
      A common formula used to determine victory points for a
      world is &quot;Port*Pop&quot;.
      This means the value of a world is the value of its starport (where
      A = 5, B = 4, etc) times the Population digit of the world.
    </p>
    <a name="Starport"></a>
