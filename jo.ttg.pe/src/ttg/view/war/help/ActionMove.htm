           The first thing you do in each turn is determine which ships you are moving.
           The Move Action Panel will appear with a list of all your ships.
           To move a ship select one or more ships from the <a href="PanelShips.htm">Ship Panel</a>.
           The valid locations that you can move a ship to are displayed in the
           destinations <a href="PanelWorlds.htm">World Panel</a>.
           You can select a world from that panel and click "Set" to assign those ships.
           Alternatively you can drag ships from the ship panel and drop them on the
           <a href="PanelStars.htm">Star Panel</a> to assign them.
           Note: if there are ships displayed in the <a href="InfoWorld.htm">World Info Panel</a>
           you can also drag and drop ships from there.
           A successful assignment will change the ships displayed on the Star Panel and
           will be reported in the status bar.
           If a assignment is incorrect for some reason, this will be indicated  by a message on the
           status bar.
           When a ship has been assigned, the "to do" arrow will be filled in.
         </p>
         <p>
           At any point you can click "Reset" to unassign all ships.
           All ships that have been marked to move will be reset to their
           original location.
         </p>
         <p>
           When you have assigned all ships you can click the "Done" button
           to move on to the next phase.
