           The Starport Information Panel gives you information on what is being
           built in a system.
           At the top the name of the world and it's icon are given.
           Beneath is the Universal Planetary Profile, the Pocket Empire to which is
           belongs and it's coat of arms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The potential construction rate is given in units per turn.
            The actual rate is subject to the availability of resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below this is a ship panel showing the ship designs that are
            in the build queue.
            You can select individual ships in the build queue and see what progress
            has been made.
            Usually only the first ships will show any aprogress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The progress is shown at the bottom as a bar indicating how much has been built
            and how much there is left to go.
            The time given in turns is also listed.
            Although, this is the time if enough resources are present.
            If there is a shortage of resources it will take longer.
          </p>
          <p>
          	The order of ships in the build queue may be moved up or down by selecting
          	the ship to move and clicking the arrow keys.
          	If construction has already started on a moved ship you will be warned that
          	you will lose that production.
          </p>
          <p>
          	Ships may be added or removed from the build queue using the plus and minus
          	keys.
          	Adding a ship brings up the <a href="DialogBuildShip.htm">Build Ship Dialog</a>.
          	If you have a ship highlighted when you add a ship it will clone that design.
          	Again, you will be warned if you try to remove a ship that has already been
          	partially constructed.
          </p>
          <p>
          	Lastly you can edit any of the designs in the build queue and change their
          	parameters.
          	Editing a ship brings up the <a href="DialogBuildShip.htm">Build Ship Dialog</a>.
          	Of course if you edit the parameters of a work in progress it will have to
          	be started from scratch.
