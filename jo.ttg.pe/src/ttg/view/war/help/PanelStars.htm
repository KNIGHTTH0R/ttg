    <h1>Star Panel</h1>

    <p>
     The Stars Panel is the main display of the game area.
     The basic view is a starfield with one hex per system
     location.
     Hexes are one parsec from center to center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hexes with a dark grey background are neutral.
      Hexes that belong to an empire are colored with
      that empire's colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of each hex is the hex number within the sector.
      A dot in the center indicates some information about the world.
      Additional information is arranged around the center.
      We'll describe each element going counter-clockwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world at the center is drawn as a single dot if it is your
      standard terrestrial world.
      If the mainworld is an asteriod belt, it will be drawn as a series
      of smaller dots.
      The dot is colored blue if there is water present on the world
      (hydrographics >= 1).
      If there is no water a orange color will be used.
      Terrestrial worlds are drawn in three sizes that indicate
      low population, median population or high population worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly above the world is a letter indicating the starport type.
      Counter-clockwise of this maybe drawn a "N" in yellow.
      If present this indicates that a naval base is present.
      Similarly, going counter-clockwise again a red "S" may appear.
      This indicates a scout base is present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly under the world is drawn the name of the world.
      If the world is of low population the name will be entirely in
      lowercase.
      If the world is of median population, the name will start with
      an uppercase letter.
      If the world is of high popuilation, the name will be all in
      uppercase.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the right of the world are drawn horizontal bars indicating known
      fleet strengths.
      The longer the bar, the higher the fleet concentration.
      Bars are drawn in the colors of the empire that owns the fleet.
      If omniscent sensors are not enabled, worlds will only show
      fleet presence if you either own it or have a ship present there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can hover the cursor over a hex and the tool tip
      text will indicate the known fleet presence.
      The value displayed shows the cumulative attack and defense factors,
      each drawn in the color of the empire owning the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars panel has a right click menu which allows you to zoom in
      or out of the view.
