           The first thing in each combat turn is the option to set some ships to
           flee to the outer system.
           This simulates ships that can either jump in to the far reaches of a system,
           or else lurk there on low power.
           Space is very big.
           It isn't hard to hide in it.
           If the system is inadequately protected you will even be able to refuel.
           If it is, though, you will not be able to refuel.
         </p>
         <p>
           At the top of the panel is the name of the system you are at and its icon.
           Beneath this is a <a href="PanelShips.htm">Ship Panel</a> containing the ships
           in that system.
           You can select one or more ships from that panel and click "Flee" to mark
           those ships as fleeing.
           As a convienence there is a "Flee Carriers" button.
           If you click this it will automatically mark any ship with zero attack
           and defense factors as fleeing.
           When a ship has been set to flee, the "to do" arrow will be filled in.
         </p>
         <p>
           At any point you can click "Reset" to unmark all ships.
         </p>
         <p>
           When you have picked all ships that are to flee you can click the "Done" button
           to move on to the actual <a href="ActionTarget.htm">combat</a>.
