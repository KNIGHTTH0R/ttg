    <h1>Game Behaviour Keys</h1>
    <p>
      This group of keys define how the game plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>GameLength</b>
      This specifies the number of turns the game can run to. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>AllowConvertNeutral</b> 
      Some games are games of conquest. 
      The players start in neutral space and fight to expand their territory 
      around them. 
      Other games pit players against each other. 
      Neutral planets remain out of the fray. 
      If this value is set to "true" then when a Neutral planet is entered 
      it converts to the side that "conquered" it. 
      If set to "false" then Neutral planets always remain neutral. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>AllowOmniscentSensors</b>
      If this value is set to "true" then you can see what ships are 
      where all over the map. 
      If set to "false" then you can only see ships that are in systems 
      that you own or have ships in. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>AllowFleetReconfiguration</b>
      If this value is set to "true" 
      then during startup you can "cash in" pre-set ships 
      and build your own, custom fleet. 
      If set to "false" then you are stuck with the ships 
      the scenario designer gives you. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>AllowIntrinsicDefense </b>
      If this value is set to "true" 
      then a world cannont be conquered 
      unless there are the same or greater attack factors in-system 
      from one enemy than the population digit of that world. 
      If set to "false" then any number of attack factors is 
      sufficient to conquer that world. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>AllowConstruction </b>
      If this value is set to "true" 
      then you can build ships during the course of the game. 
      If set to "false" then you cannot. 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ResourceGenerationFormula </b>
      This is the formula that is used to calculate 
      how many resources are produced by a world every turn. 
      The default formula is "Pop*Port*2". 
      It should only appear once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ConstructionPerTurnFormula </b>
      This is the formula that is used to calculate how much 
      ship per turn is built at each starport. 
      The default formula is "200". 
      It should only appear once.
