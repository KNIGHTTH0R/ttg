           The Choose Game action is the first action panel to come up.
           A list of pre-loaded games is presented.
           Selecting a game from this list will bring its details onto
           the info panel.
           When you have made your selection you can click the OK button
           to <a href="ActionChooseSide.htm">choose your side</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively you can create your own scenario.
            If you click on the "Add Custom" button it will bring up the
            <a href="DialogCustomGame.htm">Add Custom Game</a> dialog.
            If somone else has sent you a scenario, you can paste it in here.
            Or, if you select a scenario before clicking the button, it will bring
            up the details of that scenario and you can customize them.
            When you have finished and return here, the new scenario will appear
            on the list.
