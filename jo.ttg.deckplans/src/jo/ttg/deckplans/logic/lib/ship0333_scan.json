The strategist\/designers intended it\nto be used as part of a balanced escort\/light force grouping consisting of the\ngeneral purpose Type 1107s, the high agility Yataghan missile boats, and the\nManzikert class meson gun carriers.  The Manzikert is one of the smallest jump\ncapable craft anywhere in the Imperial inventory to carry a spinal meson gun,\nand almost everything else in the design process was sacrificed to achieve that\nobjective.<P>\n\n  The large fusion plant is usually operated at approximately one-third its\nfull capacity, which provides maneuver and life support power.  Endurance given\nbelow is at this reduced rate, and full power time can be traded on a one hour\nfor three hour basis (Operating the plant at high capacity for anything less\nthan an hour causes difficulties in changeover.)<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Manzikert class Destroyer, TL15, MCr7106\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>10800\/27000, Disp=12000t, Config=1SL, Armor=40G,\nLoaded=230373t, Unloaded=223904t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>880\/1760, Fusion=237600MW, Duration=63\/189\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>864\/1728, Maneuver=3, 432\/864, Jump=3, Cruise=750kph,\nMax=1000kph, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, Laser=System, Maser=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(FarOrbit), EMS Jammer (FarOrbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar), Neutrino Sensor (10kw), High Pen Densitometer (1km),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=120\n              MesonGun=J0x     Missile=x07\n          Batteries    1                 3\n          Bearing      1                 3\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+8\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        8\n          Bearing          8\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod9fib*3, 2*LargeHoloDisplay, 25*HeadsUpHoloDisplay,\n446*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=91 (12 bridge, 15 engineer, 11 command, 51 gunners, 2\nmaintenance), Staterooms=46, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates,\ninertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=92409kl (1 jump-3+63 days), Cargo=0, Missile Magazine=45kl\n(5b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (12hr), ObjSize=Large,\nEmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0333_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0333"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":12960.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":6480.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":13200.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":92409.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":15000.0,"number":1,"notes":"MesonGun","type":10},{"volume":54.0,"number":46,"type":11}]}
