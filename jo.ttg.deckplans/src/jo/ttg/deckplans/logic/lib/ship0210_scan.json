Obtaining parts for the\naging Aganars was becoming difficult, and the planetary government finally\napproved the construction of the Prince Normans, a replacement plan which used\nlocal resources and provided a large number of jobs for the planet's\nshipbuilding industry, which was suffering somewhat as a result of the war.<P>\n\n  The Prince Norman and its sisters are typical of front line military\nequipment at this tech level, and closely resemble cruisers seen in Vargr and\nother planetary navies.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Prince Norman class Light Cruiser, TL12, MCr24700\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>27000\/67500, Disp=30000t, Config=1AF, Armor=40F, Loaded=540kt,\nUnloaded=526kt\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>4334\/8668, Fusion=390000MW, Duration=17.9 days at full power\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>2160\/4320, Maneuver=3 (Thrusters=1.56mt), 1080\/2160, Jump=3,\nMaxSpeed=2000kph, Cruise=1500kph, TrueAcc=2.9G, Agility=3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, LaserComm=System*3, MaserComm=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit)*3, EMS Passive\n(Interstellar)*3, Neutrino Sensor (1MW), HighPenDens (50m), ActObjScan=Rout,\nActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout,\nPassEnPin=Form\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=300\n                 MesonGun=D00   Missile=x90   BeamLaser=xx8\n          Batteries       1              20               1\n          Bearing         1              18               1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+8\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        4\n          Bearing          4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod6fib*3, 20*LargeHoloDisplay, 210*HeadsUpDisplay,\n25000*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=240 (19 bridge, 122 engineer, 80 gunners, 14 command, 5\nmedical), Staterooms=120, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates,\ninertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=165000kl (1 jump-3+17.9 days), Cargo=263kl, Fuel Scoops,\nFuel Purifier (18hr), ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate Notes: 81000kl required\nfor Jump-3, 195kl\/hr for power plant.
