Faced with the usual problems of a low stellar tech\nlevel local navy, the Perkins are a compromise design.  Offensive power is\nprovided by missiles and particle accelerators which tend to be less affected\nby enemy active defenses, and a substantial amount of armor is carried to keep\nthe craft fighting as long as possible when overwhelmed by a higher tech level\nfoe.  Similar vessels may be found in Vargr and Sword Worlds navies of\nappropriate tech level.<P>\n\n  No small craft weights or costs are included below, although provision for\naccommodation of flight crew is included.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Commodore Perkins class Fleet Escort, TL10, MCr7066.6\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>5400\/13500, Disp=6000t, Config=1SL, Armor=67E, Loaded=274063t,\nUnloaded=270998t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>667\/1334, Fusion=60000MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>594\/1188, Maneuver=4 (StdGrav=429kt), 108\/216, Jump=1,\nCruise=750kph, Max=1000kph, TrueAcc=1.56G, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, Laser=System*3, Maser=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassEnScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=60\n               Missile=x80     PartAcc=030\n          Batteries     2               2\n          Bearing       2               2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+5\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod4fib*3, 50*HeadsUpDisplay, 21000*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=185 (14 bridge, 23 engineer, 31 maintenance, 32 gunners,\n30 flight, 40 troops, 12 command, 3 medical), Staterooms=93, Env=basic env,\nbasic ls, extended ls, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=29700kl (1 jump-1+30 days), Cargo=486kl, Missile\nMagazine=1000kl (100b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (18hr), SubCraft=600ton\nSmall Craft Bay, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Faint<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0168"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":8910.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":1620.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":10005.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":486.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":29700.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":1350.0,"number":2,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":2,"notes":"PartAcc","type":9},{"volume":54.0,"number":93,"type":11}]}
