However, many worlds are not\nlocated in such favorable positions, and ships with more capable jump drives\nare needed to service them.  Thus jump-2 and jump-3 versions of standard jump-1\nvessels are frequently encountered in the Imperium.  This R2 can be built using\nmany of the same standard assemblies used by the basic Type R. Like the basic\nType R, the R2 shown below is fitted with a minimal maneuver drive, and may not\nland or take off from a planet with a local gravity of more than 0.9Gs while\nfully loaded, and is frequently dependent on the use of orbital facilities.  A\nlaunch is carried to provide some capability for servicing worlds where landing\nis not practical.  No weapons are shown in the ship below, although 54kl of\nvolume have been reserved for the installation of up to four turrets, and the\nbasic control system can handle any weapons installation of up to MCr12 base\ncost.<P>\n\n  In the current unsettled conditions prevailing in the Imperium, Type R2\nmerchants such as this are frequently found carrying both a substantial weapons\narray and improved sensor systems.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Type R2 Merchant, TL13, MCr100.92 (MCr80.74 discount)\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>360\/900, Disp=400, Config=4SL, Armor=40F, Loaded=5229t,\nUnloaded=2599t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>8\/16, Fusion=963MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>8\/16, Maneuver=1 (Thrusters=5200t), 11\/22, Jump=2,\nTrueAcc=0.99G, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Planetary), EMS Passive(Interplanetary),\nActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+3\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod1bis*3, 3*HeadsUpHoloDisplay, 130*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=5 (1 bridge, 1 medic, 2 engineer, 1 steward),\nPassengers=7, LowPassengers=9, Staterooms=12, LowBerths=9, Env=basic env, basic\nls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=1196kl, Cargo=2356kl (174.5t), Fuel Purifier (24hrs), Fuel\nScoops, SubCraft=1*20t Horde launch, ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Faint<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0244_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0244"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":108.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":162.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":120.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":2356.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":1196.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":54.0,"number":12,"type":11}]}
