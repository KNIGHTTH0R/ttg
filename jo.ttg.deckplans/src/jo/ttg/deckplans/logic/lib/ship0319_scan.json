The vessel is semi-streamlined, allowing gas giant refueling, as well\nas landing on atmosphere 0 or 1 worlds.  Other atmospheric operations are not\npossible, hence the large complement of ship's boats.  Bilstein made the design\navailable for general sale in 1087, and nineteen vessels had been ordered by\n1106.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n[Adapted from Traveller Adventure 4:Leviathan.  To adapt to MegaTraveller it\nwas necessary to reduce the cargo capacity and the total number of\nstaterooms--fuel took up more space than it used to.Back-up jump and maneuver\nsystems were retained from the original design, despite being a questionable\ndesign feature in my opinion.  Since the Leviathans were built at Glisten, I\nalso opted to make them TL15 rather than 13 as stated in the adventure.  Crew\nrequirements under the new system were lower, so reducing staterooms was not a\nproblem.  Additional cargo space could be obtained by running with the shuttle\nand pinnace holds full.]<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Leviathan class Merchant Cruiser, TL15, MCr1123.04\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>1620\/4050, Disp=1800t, Config=4SL, Armor=46G, Loaded=24272t,\nUnloaded=21982t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>74\/148, Fusion=19800MW, Duration=30 days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>179\/358, Maneuver=4, 81\/162, Maneuver=2, 65\/130, Jump=3, 49\/98,\nJump=2, Cruise=750kph, Max=1000kph, Agility=3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3 Laser=System*3 Maser=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, Neutrino Sensor (10kw)*3, High Pen Densitometer\n(1km)*3, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=18\n               Missile=x03     BeamLaser=xx5\n          Batteries      1                 2\n          Bearing        1                 2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+10\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7fib*3, 1*LargeHoloDisplay, 3*HeadsUpHoloDisplay,\n120*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=29 (3 bridge, 5 engineer, 3 gunners, 12 flight, 4 command,\n2 medical), Passengers=11, Staterooms=20, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls,\ngrav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=11988kl (1 jump-3+30 days), Cargo=170.5, Fuel Scoops, Fuel\nPurifier (48hr), SubCraft=1*95t shuttle, 1*40t pinnace, 2*20t launch,\nObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0319_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0319"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":2673.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":972.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":1110.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":170.5,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":11988.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":2,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":20,"type":11}]}
