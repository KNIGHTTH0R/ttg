After\nsuccessful evaluation trials, construction was begun in 1111.  It was intended\nthat the Lobachevsky class fleet tenders be updated as new squadrons of 9 NXs\nwere available to replace the squadrons of 15 10kton riders.  This changeover\nwas not complete in 1117 when most of the IGN was deployed to fight the Aslan\nin the Trojan Reach sector.  Maneuver and life support require about 40% of the\ntotal power plant capacity, and each hour at full combat power uses 2.5 hours\nof endurance.  A fuel purifier is provided even though it is not required for\nthe craft's own fuel, for tactical flexibility in refueling of the parent\ncraft.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Type NX Battlerider, TL15, MCr30,377.5\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>14400\/36000, Disp=16000, Conf=1SL, Armor=82G,\nLoaded=1,078,354t, Unloaded=1,039,280t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>1934\/3868, Fusion=522000MW, Dur=30 days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>2448\/4896, Maneuver=6, Agility=1, (ActualThrust=1.36G)\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, LaserComm=System*3, MaserComm=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Far Orbit)*3, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, High Pen Densitometer(1km)*3, Neutrino Sensor(10kw)*3,\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=160\n              Meson Gun=N0x     Missile=x90     BeamLaser=x09\n          Batteries     1                6                  1\n          Bearing       1                6                  1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+9, Nuclear Damper-9*2, MesonScreen-9*2\n              SandCaster=x09     Repulsors=x5x\n          Batteries        3                4\n          Bearing          3                4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Comp9fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*4, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*100,\nHoloLink*6200\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=206 (15 Bridge, 24 Engineering, 60 Maintenance, 52\nGunnery, 40 Flight, 13 Command, 2 Medical), Staterooms*105, Env=basic env,\nbasic ls, ext ls, grav plates, inert comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=75168kl, Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (24hr), Cargo=0,\nMissile Magazine=750kl (50b-r), Subcraft=4*Type K Gunboats, ObjSize=large,\nEmLevel=strong<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0334"},"configuration":3,"items":[{"volume":36720.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":29010.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":75168.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":5400.0,"number":4,"notes":"Type K Gunboats","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":6,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6}]}
