Hundreds are in\nservice with the planetary navies of the industrial worlds of Lunion and\nStrouden in the Spinward Marches alone. While the fuel supply is sufficient for\nthirty full days of operation at maximum power, it is more often stretched to\nprovide 75 days of operation at 40% power, enough for 1-G maneuver and full\nlife support.  If operated in life support and passive sensor only mode, as\nwith a loiter operation during an enemy attack on the system, only one percent\nof the power capacity is required.  This would allow the vessels to wait up to\n4375 days between fuelings--which is to say, as long as necessary.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Chariot class SDB, TL13, MCr757.85\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600, Config=4SL, Armor=70F, Unloaded=29760t,\nLoaded=30600t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>70\/140, Fusion=9270MW, Dur=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>94\/188, Maneuver=6 (Thrusters=67600t), MaxSpeed=1000kph,\nCruise=750kph, NOE=170kph, TrueAcc=2.2G, Agility=2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2, LaserComm=System*2, MaserComm=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active (Far Orbit)*2, EMS Jammer (Far Orbit)*2, EMS\nPassive (Interstellar)*2, Neutrino Sensor (100KW)*2, High Pen Densitometer\n(100m)*2, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff,\nPassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n           BeamLaser=xx3             Missile=x03\n         Batteries     2                       3\n         Bearing       2                       3\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM=+10\n         SandCasters=xx4\n         Batteries     1\n         Bearing       1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>CompMod7*3, HUDHoloDisplay*6, HoloLink*120\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=11 (2 Bridge, 2 Engineers, 2 Gunners, 1 Maintenance, 2\nFlight, 1 Command, 1 Medic), Staterooms=11, Env=basic env, basic ls, ext ls,\ngrav plates, inert comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=3780kl, Cargo=73kl, MissileMagazine=90kl (100 b-r),\nSubcraft=1*30t Ship's Boat, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Faint<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0247_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0247"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":1377.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":1050.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":73.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":3780.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":405.0,"number":1,"notes":"30t Ship's Boat","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":0,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":11,"type":11}]}
