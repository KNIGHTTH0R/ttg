The unsettled situation in the Imperium\nhas left SIE unable to procure ships from their usual suppliers at Glisten. The\nAthelstan is a modified Type R2 design, and is fairly typical of ships built in\nfrontier areas with an integral refueling capability, a maneuver drive capable\nof making a landing while fully loaded on any inhabitable planet, and a full\narmament package.<P>\n\n  Unlike many other SIE vessels, the Athelstan does not ordinarily carry a\nrobotic crew supplement since the supply of cheap robots has also dried up.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Athelstan class Merchant (Type R2 mod), TL11, MCr157.06\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>360\/900, Disp=400t, Config=4SL, Armor=40E, Loaded=5828t,\nUnloaded=4296t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>20\/40, Fusion=1800MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>18\/36, Maneuver=2 (Thrusters=13000t), 11\/22, Jump=2,\nMax=1000kph, Cruise=750kph, TrueAcc=2.23G, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2, LaserComm=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Planetary), EMS Passive(Interplanetary),\nActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=4\n               Missile=x02     BeamLaser=xx3\n          Batteries      1                 1\n          Bearing        1                 1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+4\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod2*3, 8*HeadsUpDisplay, 665*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=11 (2 bridge, 2 engineer, 4 gunners, 1 command, 1 steward,\n1 medical), Staterooms=20, Passengers=9, LowBerths=20, LowPassengers=20,\nEnv=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=1460kl (1 jump-2+30 days), Cargo=1424kl, Missiles=60\n(20b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (24hr), ObjSize=Avg,\nEmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0184_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0184"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":270.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":162.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":300.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":1424.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":1460.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":20,"type":11}]}
