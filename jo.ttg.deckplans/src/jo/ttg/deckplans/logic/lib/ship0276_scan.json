With Jump-4 capability, the Metlay is still capable of\nperforming valuable work for the Imperial Navy, although most new construction\nis for frontier planetary navies.  Members of the class are traditionally named\nafter posthumous winners of the Imperial Navy's Medal for Conspicuous\nGallantry.  Normal operation of the vessel (full maneuver power and life\nsupport) requires 66% of the power plant capacity, and the rated endurance\nshown below is based on this figure.<P>\n\nhis draft design was produced on 29 September 1990.  In order to fit the\ndesired main armament of a meson gun bay, it is necessary to have a power plant\nroughly twice as large as the maneuver\/life support requirement. Endurance\ngiven below is for no combat use of power.  Combat power consumes 2 days of\nnon-combat power per day.  Basically, this was designed backwards from the TL15\nversion, the main difference being the large increase in power plant size\nneeded at TL14, and corresponding changes in fuel capacity.  To keep the fuel\ncapacity at over 30 days at running power, it was necessary to trim the fuel\npurifier back to 18 hour capability.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Imperial Fleet Escort, 10000 tons, TL14, MCr8291\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>9000\/22500, Disp=10000t, Config=1SL, Armor=52G, Loaded=175756t,\nUnloaded=169926t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>1267\/2534, Fusion=171000MW, Duration=35\/105\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>990\/1980, Maneuver=4 (Thrusters=715kt), 450\/900, Jump=4,\nTrueAcc=4.07G, Cruise=750kph, Max=1000kph, Agility=4\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, Laser=System*3, Maser=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, Neutrino Sensor (10kw)*3, High Pen Densitometer\n(250m)*3, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=100\n              MesonGun=05x     Missile=x90     BeamLaser=xx9\n          Batteries     1               4                  1\n          Bearing       1               4                  1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+11, Meson Screen-6*2, Nuclear Damper-6*2\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        4\n          Bearing          4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod8fib*3, 4*LargeHoloDisplay, 25*HeadsUpHoloDisplay,\n670*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=107 (12 bridge, 23 engineer, 5 maintenance, 51 gunners, 3\nflight, 11 command, 2 medical), Staterooms=54, Env=basic env, basic ls,\nextended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=73842kl (1 jump-4+35 days), Cargo=0, Missile\nMagazine=500kl (50b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (18hr),\nSubCraft=1*Pinnace,<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0276"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":14850.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":6750.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":19005.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":73842.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":4,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":1350.0,"number":1,"notes":"MesonGun","type":9},{"volume":54.0,"number":54,"type":11}]}
