The class was composed of 37 vessels, of which 23 remain in service\nas of 1117.  The origin of the class was somewhat unusual--in 956 the Planetary\nNavy of Trin had ordered a large number of Patrol Cruisers which were later\ncanceled (in 963) due to budgetary considerations.  The uncompleted hulls\n(ranging from 40-90% completed at cancellation) remained in orbital storage for\n39 years while the contract cancellation case was in litigation. Following the\nconclusion of the lawsuits, the hulls were sold for a small fraction of their\noriginal cost in a sealed bid auction to TrinTechnics and completed as fast\nmerchants.  The thrusters are sufficient to allow take off and landing with a\nfull load on almost any inhabited planet, freeing the ship from dependence on\norbital facilities.<P>\n\n  Many Tallis class vessels are operated with incomplete crews, allowing more\nthan three middle passengers to be carried.  Stewards are seldom encountered.\nWith the survivors of the class having been in service for over 100 years,\ncareful maintenance is a high priority.  If found for sale, it could be\nexpected that a Tallis would cost less than MCr45 at present.  Annual\nmaintenance, however would be based on the original cost, and might run to as\nmuch as three or four times the original expectations.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Tallis class Merchant, TL14, MCr166.52\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>396\/990, Disp=440t, Config=1AF, Armor=40G, Loaded=5478t,\nUnloaded=3124t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>15\/30, Fusion=1980MW, Duration=30\/90\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>20\/40, Maneuver=2 (Thrusters=14300t), 12\/24, Jump=2,\nMaxSpeed=1770kph, Cruise=1328kph, Agility=2, TrueAcc=2.61G\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit), ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=4\n                Missile=x03\n          Batteries       2\n          Bearing         2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+6\n             Sandcaster=xx4\n          Batteries       2\n          Bearing         2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod3*3, 4*HeadsUpHoloDisplay, 21*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=9 (2 bridge, 2 engineer, 3 gunners, 1 command, 1 medic),\nMidPassengers=3, Staterooms=12, LowBerths=20, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended\nls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=1683kl (1 jump-2+30 days), Cargo=2236kl (165.6t), Fuel\nScoops, Fuel Purifier (18hr-purifies jump fuel alone in 9hr), ObjSize=Avg,\nEmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0274_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0274"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":297.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":178.2,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":225.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":2236.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":1683.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":12,"type":11}]}
