The example shown below is fairly typical, and\nincludes an armament package consisting of a triple beam laser turret, a triple\nmissile turret, and a triple sandcaster turret.  Space and control capability\nfor up to three additional non-laser turrets has been reserved. With an\nacceleration of 1.08Gs fully loaded, this Type M is capable of taking off from\nTerran-sized planet under most circumstances.  A launch is included to provide\nsome flexibility in operation.  A full crew is seldom carried, with a gunner\nand the dedicated launch crew being the most likely positions to be left empty.\nP>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Type M Merchant, TL13, MCr181.6\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600, Config=4SL, Armor=40F, Loaded=7227t,\nUnloaded=4290t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>11\/22, Fusion=1440MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>11\/22, Maneuver=1 (Thrusters=7800t), 22\/44, Jump=3, NOE=30kph,\nCruise=90kph, Max=120kph, TrueAcc=1.08G, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit), EMS Passive(Interplanetary),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassEnScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n              Missile=x03     BeamLaser=x04\n          Batteries     1                 1\n          Bearing       1                 1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+9\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        1\n          Bearing          1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod3*3, 4*HeadsUpHoloDisplay, 24*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=13 (2 bridge, 2 engineer, 3 gunnery, 2 flight, 1 command,\n2 stewards, 1 medic), Passengers=11, LowPassengers=20, Staterooms=24,\nLowBerths=20, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=2196kl(1 Jump-3+30 days), Cargo=2783kl (206t), Fuel\nScoops, Subcraft=1*20t Horde launch, ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0248_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0248"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":162.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":324.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":165.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":2783.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":2196.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":20.0,"number":1,"notes":"20t Horde launch","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":24,"type":11}]}
