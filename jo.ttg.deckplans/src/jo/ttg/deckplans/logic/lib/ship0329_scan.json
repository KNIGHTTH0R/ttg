A mainstay of the fleet, it is found as the\nmain battlerider class aboard the Lobachevsky class fleet tenders, as an\nauxiliary aboard some of the large battleships, and as an independent system\ndefense monitor.  Traditionally the individual vessels of this class do not\nhave names.  They are referred to tactically by a call sign based on that of\ntheir parent vessel, or by the last three digits of the tail number. They are\nalso traditionally decorated with designs suggestive of fierce carnivores.\nThis Mark II version entered service just prior to the outbreak of the Fifth\nFrontier War and differs from the Mark I by the addition of a meson screen, and\na substantial reduction in armor, with a corresponding increase in thruster\nperformance.  The Mark II was very popular with those crews fortunate enough to\nbe equipped with them during the opening stages of the war.  Some Mark Is still\nremained in service as<P>\n\n of 1117, though primarily as independent system defense boats.  Maneuver and\nlife support power requires about 32% of the power plant full capacity, and the\nendurance shown below can be tripled for non-combat missions.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>10kton Rider Mark II, TL15, MCr8172\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>9000\/22500, Disp=10000, Conf=1AF, Armor=52G, Loaded=160658t,\nUnloaded=155669t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>1494\/2988, Fusion=403,200MW, Dur=12.5 days at full power\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>1530\/3060, Maneuver=6 (Thrusters=1105kt), TrueAcc=6.88G,\nMaxSpeed=4200kph, Cruise=3150kph, Agility=6\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, LaserComm=System*3, MaserComm=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Far Orbit)*3, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, High Pen Densitometer(1km)*3, Neutrino Sensor(10kw)*3,\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=100\n              Meson Gun=J0x     Missile=x90     BeamLaser=x09\n          Batteries     1                6                  1\n          Bearing       1                6                  1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+14, Nuclear Damper=9, Meson Screen=9\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Comp9fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*2, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*35,\nHoloLink*12\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=100 (12 Bridge, 18 Engineering, 5 Maintenance, 51 Gunnery,\n11 Command, 3 Medical), Staterooms*50, Env=basic env, basic ls, ext ls, grav\nplates, inert comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=60562kl, Fuel Scoops, Cargo=0, ObjSize=Large,\nEmLevel=Strong<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0329"},"configuration":3,"items":[{"volume":22950.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":22410.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":60562.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":6,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6}]}
