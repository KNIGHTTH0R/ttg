Equipped with a fuel purifier, a squadron of up to 30\nforty ton landers or fighters, and a company of marines, the Majestic is\ncapable of independent operations, and is frequently found as a flagship for a\nsquadron of smaller craft.  Normal operating power is approximately 50% of the\nfull power capacity, and the endurance given below is for non-combat\noperations.  Each hour at combat power uses fuel for two hours at non-combat\npower. Cost of auxiliary craft is not included below.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Majestic class Heavy Cruiser, TL11, MCr18160\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>27000\/67500, Disp=30000t, Config=1SL, Armor=52E,\nLoaded=638759t, Unloaded=580580t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>3000\/6000, Fusion=270000MW, Duration=30\/90\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>1350\/2700, Maneuver=2 (Thrusters=975kt), 810\/1620, Jump=2,\nTrueAcc=1.53G, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, Laser=System*3, Maser=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, Neutrino Sensor (1Gw), High Pen Densitometer (1m),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Form, PassObjPin=Form,\nPassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Form\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=300\n               PartAcc=K00     Missile=x70     BeamLaser=xx8\n          Batteries    1                12                 5\n          Bearing      1                11                 5\n               PlasmaGun=x04\n          Batteries        1\n          Bearing          1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+5\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        8\n          Bearing          7\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod5fib*3, 150*HeadsUpDisplay, 49000*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=432 (18 bridge, 101 engineer, 17 maintenance, 65 gunners,\n90 flight, 120 troops, 17 command, 4 medical), Staterooms=432, Env=basic env,\nbasic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=109350kl (1 jump-2+30 days half power), Cargo=49774kl,\nMissile Magazine=1500kl (50b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (12hr),\nSubCraft=30*40ton, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Strong<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0189"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":20250.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":12150.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":45000.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":49774.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":109350.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":12,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":5,"notes":"PlasmaGun","type":6},{"volume":60000.0,"number":1,"notes":"PartAcc","type":10},{"volume":54.0,"number":432,"type":11}]}
