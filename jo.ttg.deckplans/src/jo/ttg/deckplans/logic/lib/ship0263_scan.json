The first vessel in the class was completed by\nStrouden and flown on 343-1096.  One of the main flaws of this design was\nparticularly evident as a result of its performance in the Fifth Frontier\nWar--the lack of an onboard fuel purification capability.  Two ships of a six\nship squadron were lost to misjumps during the retreat to Lunion when forced to\njump immediately after a gas giant refueling.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Lord Adrian class Light Cruiser, TL13, MCr23981\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>27000\/67500, Disp=30000, Config=1SL, Armor=67F, Loaded=984065t,\nUnloaded=960756t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>2000\/4000, Fusion=270000MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>2160\/4320, Maneuver=3, 1080\/2160, Jump=3, Cruise=750kph,\nMax=1000kph, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, Laser=System, Maser=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(FarOrbit), EMS Passive(Interstellar), Neutrino\nSensor (100kw), High Pen Densitometer (100m), ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout,\nPassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=300\n              MesonGun=E00     Missile=x90     BeamLaser=x09\n          Batteries    1                8                  2\n          Bearing      1                8                  2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+6, Nuclear Damper-3, Meson Screen-3\n              Repulsor=x7x     SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries     8                   11\n          Bearing       8                   10\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7fib*3, 10*LargeHoloDisplay,\n150*HeadsUpHoloDisplay, 1700*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=330 (17 bridge, 63 engineers, 32 maintenance, 52 gunnery,\n120 flight, 30 troops, 14 command, 2 medics), Staterooms=60, Env=basic env,\nbasic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=189000kl, Cargo=9079kl, Missile Magazine=2000kl(50b-r),\nFuel Scoops, LaunchTube=50tons, SubCraft=40*50ton, ObjSize=Large,\nEmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0263"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":32400.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":16200.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":30000.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":9079.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":189000.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":1350.0,"number":8,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":15000.0,"number":1,"notes":"MesonGun","type":10},{"volume":1350.0,"number":8,"notes":"Repulsor","type":9},{"volume":54.0,"number":60,"type":11}]}
