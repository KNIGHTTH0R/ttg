It is, however,\nprimarily targeted as civilian use. In and of itself the Tasadian is Jump-6,\nmaneuver-3. However, it can be externally fitted with excess ships, or cargo\npods up to a maximum tonnage of 10000t. Performance degrades as follows:<P>\n<PRE>\n            Jump-6 @    0t carried externally\n            Jump-5 @  500t carried externally\n            Jump-4 @ 1200t carried externally\n            Jump-3 @ 2250t carried externally\n            Jump-2 @ 4000t carried externally\n            Jump-1 @ 7000t carried externally\n<\/PRE>\n      [Some referees may allow carried spacecraft to be able to cycle their\njump-drives in sync with the parent craft. This allows a greater performance in\njump rates than listed above. Overall tonnage of craft should be compared\nwith\noverall tonnage of cycling drives. Subtract one from the percent to get jump\nrating.]<P>\n\n      The internal bays may be used for 300t of small craft (or 390t of cargo)\nand 300t of spacecraft (or 330t of cargo). <P>\n\n      Tasadians only exist in private hands in extremely populated and\nprosperous regions. They are quite widely used by corporates in almost all\nregions due to the diversity of functions they can preform. Tasadian's can be\nfound on bulk freight routes, shipping incomplete starships hulls from B\nspaceports to A spaceports for finishing work, or just as fast transports for\neither special cargo or for ships that really need to get from one point to\nanother faster than their drives allow. The Navy occasionally partially\nsubsidises the construction of Tasadians in return for call-up clauses in their\ncontract. They do not rate as Naval carriers but can be\nof some strategic value in maintaining supply lines. <P>\n\n      It should be noted that a Tasadian has no intrinsic way of refueling and\nneeds to either carry a fuel shuttle or else buy fuel (which is prohibitively\nexpensive given the size of its tanks).<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Tasadian Commercial Carrier, TL12, MCr1561\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>2700\/6750, Disp=3000t, Config=7, Armour=40G, Loaded=58430,\nUnloaded=33875\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>203\/508, Fusion=18300MW, Duration=30\/90\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD> 180\/450, Maneuver=3(1), 189\/473, Jump=6(1), Cruise=750kph,\nMax=1000kph, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active (Planetary), EMS Passive (Substellar),\nActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff, PassEngScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=30 (1280MW reserved for armaments)\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>+6\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod6*3, 2*LargeHoloDisp, 9941*DynaLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=22 (6 bridge, 9 engineer, (4 gunners), 3 command),\nStaterooms=25, Env=all\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=1100t, Cargo=97t, Fuel Purefier(24h), ObjSize=Average,\nEmmLevel=Moderate, 300t bay for small craft, 300t bay for spacecraft, external\nfittings for 7000t.<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0208_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: J.Grant\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0208"},"configuration":7,"items":[{"volume":3240.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":2835.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":3045.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":1309.5,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":14850.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":54.0,"number":25,"type":11}]}
