A mainstay of the fleet, it is found as the\nmain battlerider class aboard the Lobachevsky class fleet tenders, as an\nauxiliary aboard some of the large battleships, and as an independent system\ndefense monitor.  Traditionally the individual vessels of this class do not\nhave names.  They are referred to tactically by a call sign based on that of\ntheir parent vessel, or by the last three digits of the tail number. They are\nalso traditionally decorated with designs suggestive of fierce carnivores.\nManeuver and life support power requires about 30% of the power plant full\ncapacity, and the endurance shown below is calculated on that basis.  Operation\nat full power consumes 3 endurance hours per hour of operation.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>10kton Rider, TL15, MCr19,772 (15,818 in mass)\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>9000\/22500, Disp=10000, Conf=1AF, Armor=70G, Loaded=311,861t,\nUnloaded=307,130t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>1494\/2988, Fusion=403,200MW, Dur=36\/106\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>1530\/3060, Maneuver=6 (Thrusters=1105kt), TrueAcc=3.54G,\nAgility=3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, LaserComm=System, MaserComm=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(Far Orbit), EMS Jammer(Far Orbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar), High Pen Densitometer(1km), Neutrino Sensor(10kw),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=100\n              Meson Gun=J0x     Missile=x90     BeamLaser=x09\n          Batteries     1                4                  2\n          Bearing       1                4                  2\n             Fusion Gun=x09\n          Batteries       1\n          Bearing         1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+11, Nuclear Damper=9\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Comp9fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*4, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*20,\nHoloLink*9700\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=135 (15 Bridge, 18 Engineering, 35 Maintenance, 51\nGunnery, 12 Command, 4 Medical), Staterooms*68, Env=basic env, basic ls, ext\nls, grav plates, inert comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=59,000kl, Fuel Scoops, Cargo=600kl, ObjSize=large,\nEmLevel=moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0328"},"configuration":3,"items":[{"volume":22950.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":22410.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":600.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":59000.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":4,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6}]}
