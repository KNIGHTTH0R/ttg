At the\noutbreak of the War, the Collace government nationalized the ships, which were\nthen operated by their originally trained crews under the navy flag. The ships\n(renamed Ranger, Enterprise and Fortunate by the navy) were operated as\ncommerce raiders in the Glisten sector.  Ranger was captured while docked at\nGlisten, Enterprise destroyed at Overnale, and the final fate of the Fortunate\nis unknown.  It is suspected that it was destroyed in a jump accident after\nbeing damaged in an engagement with local defense forces at New Rome.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Brightside class privateer, TL13, MCr546.7\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600, Config=1SL, Armor=40F, Loaded=9016t,\nUnloaded=8168t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>61\/122, Fusion=8235MW, Duration=24days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>60\/1200, Maneuver=4 (Thrusters=42.9kt), 22\/44, Jump=3,\nCruise=750kph, Max=1000kph, TrueAcc=4.76G, Agility=4\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2, LaserComm=System*2, MaserComm=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*2, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*2, HighPenDensitometer (100m), Neutrino Sensor(100kw),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff,\nPassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n              Missile=x03     BeamLaser=x04\n          Batteries     1                 4\n          Bearing       1                 4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+5\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        1\n          Bearing          1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7*3, 4*HeadsUpHoloDisplay, 80*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=19 (2 bridge, 2 engineer, 3 gunners, 3 flight, 6 troops, 2\ncommand, 1 medic), Staterooms=10, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav\nplates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=4255.2kl (Jump-3+24 days), Cargo=103kl,\nMissileMagazine=30kl(100b-r), Fuel Purifier (72hrs), Fuel Scoops,\nSubCraft=Armed Launch, ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Faint<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0246_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0246"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":891.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":324.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":915.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":103.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":4255.2,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":10,"type":11}]}
