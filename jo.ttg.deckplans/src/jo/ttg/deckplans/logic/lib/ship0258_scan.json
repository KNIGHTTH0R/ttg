The last of the sixty vessels was commissioned in 1029.  The\nships are named for famous battles of history.  At the outbreak of the Fifth\nFrontier War, the Aganars were the oldest class of vessels still in service\nwith the IGN, and were committed to action immediately as one of the few meson\ngun carrier classes in use.  Merely the technological equals of their opponents\nin the Collace Independence Fleet, and heavily outnumbered at every encounter\ndue to the vagaries of their pre-war deployment, the Aganar squadrons were\nvirtually annihilated in the opening weeks of the war.  Between combat losses\nand the destruction of a number of damaged ships under repair during the brief\nCollace occupation of Glisten, only a single ship out of the sixty, the IGNS\nAlesia, survived through the end of the war.  The Alesia was reclassified as a\nfleet escort during the fleet reorganization of 1112, and was still in service\nas a training vessel <P>\n\nas of 1118.<P>\n\n  Short duration was a major problem of the class--immediate refueling upon\nentering a system was a necessity, but was considered an acceptable trade-off\nin return for the meson gun mounted on such a comparatively small hull.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Aganar Class Light Cruiser, TL13, MCr9460\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>7200\/18000, Disp=8000, Config=1SL, Armor=52F, Unloaded=190700t,\nLoaded=194131t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>1840\/3680, Fusion=248400MW, Dur=13.6 days at 21% power\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>288\/576, Jump=3, 576\/1152, Maneuver=3 (Thrusters=416kt),\nTrueAcc=2.14G, MaxSpeed=1000kph, Cruise=750kph, Agility=2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, LaserComm=System*3, MaserComm=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Far Orbit)*3, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, High Pen Densitometer(100m)*3, Neutrino\nSensor(100kw)*3, ActObjScan=Routine, ActObjPin=Routine, PassObjScan=Diff,\nPassObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Routine, PassEnPin=Difficult\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=80\n           MesonGun=E0x   Missile=x90   BeamLaser=xx9\n          Batteries 1              5                1\n          Bearing   1              5                1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+9, NuclearDamper-3, MesonScreen-3\n             Sandcasters=xx9\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*2, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*70,\nHoloLink*1200\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=122 (12 command, 13 bridge, 34 engineer, 54 gunnery, 6\nMaintenance, 2 medical), Staterooms=61, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls,\ngrav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=31170kl, Cargo=0, Missile Magazine=2500kl (100 battery\nrounds), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (18hrs), ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Strong\nNotes: Fuel Consumption at full power 138kl\/hr, at 21% power (full maneuver and\nlife support) 29.3kl\/hr, 21600kl per Jump-3<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0258"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":8640.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":4320.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":27600.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":31170.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":1350.0,"number":5,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":15000.0,"number":1,"notes":"MesonGun","type":10},{"volume":54.0,"number":61,"type":11}]}
