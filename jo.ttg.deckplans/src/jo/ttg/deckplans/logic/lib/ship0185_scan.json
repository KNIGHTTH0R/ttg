Designed to be produced and maintained by worlds of\naverage technology, it is not really suited to the difficult conditions imposed\nby our current political difficulties.  The base model, as shown below, is\nproduced with no fuel purification plant and no weapons package. Either can be\ninstalled (and often both are), but at a cost in cargo space. The control\nsystem is sufficient to allow up to MCr9 of weapons to be installed. The\nminimal thruster installation does not permit takeoffs or landings on most\ninhabitable planets while the ship is fully loaded.  As a result, a launch is\ncarried to provide some limited integral shuttle capability.  When sufficient\ncargo has been offloaded by the launch, the ship may land.  Frugal captains\nusually run the ship with the launch's cargo bay loaded if possible, which adds\nan additional 200kl of cargo capacity.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>River class Merchant (Type R), TL11, MCr100.07\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>360\/900, Disp=400t, Config=4SL, Armor=40E, Loaded=6125t,\nUnloaded=2820t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>11\/22, Fusion=960MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>8\/16, Maneuver=1 (Thrusters=5200t), 8\/16, Jump=1,\nTrueAcc=0.85G, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Planetary), ActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod1*3, 4*HeadsUpDisplay, 860*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=6 (2 bridge, 2 engineer, 1 steward, 1 medical),\nStaterooms=12, Passengers=6, LowBerths=9, LowPassengers=9, Env=basic env, basic\nls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=886kl (1 jump-1+30 days), Cargo=2810kl, Fuel Scoops,\nObjSize=Avg, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0185_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0185"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":108.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":108.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":165.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":2810.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":886.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":54.0,"number":12,"type":11}]}
