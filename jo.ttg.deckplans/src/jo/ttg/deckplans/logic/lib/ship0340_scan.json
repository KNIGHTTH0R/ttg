As conceived, the strike\ncruiser is almost all offense.  Defensive considerations are limited to light\narmor, a small battery of lasers and sand casters, and fairly high agility. (I\ndon't think you can get a whole lot more agile than this and still provide\npower for a spinal mount.)  Endurance calculations are based on running power\ncovering life support and 4-G acceleration (as well as the low power weapons,\nif needed). Running power is 48% of full power, which is close enough to say\nthat one combat hour costs two endurance hours.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Imperial Strike Cruiser, TL15, MCr95830\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>45000\/112500, Disp=50000, Config=1SL, Armor=52G,\nUnloaded=730,396t, Loaded=759,869t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>3336\/6668, Fusion=900000MW, Dur=33\/99\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>2250\/4500, Jump=4, 7650\/15300, Maneuver=6 (Thrusters=5.53mt),\nMaxSpeed=1000kph, Cruise=750kph, TrueAcc=7.27G, Agility=7\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*5, LaserComm=System*5, MaserComm=System*5\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Far Orbit)*5, EMS Jammer(Far Orbit)*5, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*5, High Pen Densitometer(1km)*5, Neutrino Sensor(10kw)*5,\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=500\n           MesonGun=N0x   BeamLaser=xx6   Missile=x90\n         Batteries  1                 2            40\n         Bearing    1                 2            30\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+16\n          Sandcaster=xx9\n          Batteries    7\n          Bearing      6\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod9fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*10,\nHeadsUpHoloDisplay*190, HoloLink*45600\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=177 (13 command, 26 bridge, 74 engineer, 53 gunnery, 8\nMaintenance, 3 medical), Staterooms=90, Env=Basic env, basic ls, extended ls,\ngrav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=349612kl (1 Jump3+33 days running power), Cargo=0, Missile\nMagazine=10000kl (100 b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (12hr), ObjSize=Large,\nEmLevel=Strong<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0340"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":114750.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":33750.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":50040.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":349612.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":3,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":40,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":25000.0,"number":1,"notes":"MesonGun","type":10},{"volume":54.0,"number":90,"type":11}]}
