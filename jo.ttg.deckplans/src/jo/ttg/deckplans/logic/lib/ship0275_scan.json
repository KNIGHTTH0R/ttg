This peculiarity in IGN nomenclature was adjusted to match Imperial\nnorms after the Fifth Frontier War, and the survivors of the initial class of\n300 were redesignated as 'light escorts'.  As the Type 1107 destroyers became\navailable after the war, the Chus were placed in mothballs at Glisten, and\nseveral of the ships which had been severely damaged during the war and hastily\nrepaired were scrapped.  At the time of the Emperor's assassination, the Naval\nDepartment at Glisten was considering transferring some of the mothballed ships\nto local planetary navies, or selling some with weapons packages removed as\ncouriers.  There was little public interest in the latter concept, and the\nformer was shelved when the Aslan advance made it necessary to reactivate the\nships to support the Imp<P>\n\nerial Navy in the Trojan Reach sector.<P>\n\n  Following the war, most of the active vessels were re-equipped with Type 1112\nlanding boats in place of their original pinnaces  The statistics shown below\nreflect this change.  The vessel typically operates at 26% power, enough for\nlife support and 1-G maneuver, allowing up to 60 days per fuel load.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Kao Chu class Destroyer, TL14, MCr1292.4\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>900\/2250, Disp=1000, Config=1SL, Armor=67G, Unloaded=28648t,\nLoaded=30586t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>122\/244, Fusion=16470MW, Dur=15.5 days at full power\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>27\/54, Jump 2, 153\/306, Maneuver=6 (Thrusters=110.5kt),\nMaxSpeed=1000kph, Cruise=750kph, TrueAcc=3.61G, Agility=3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*3, Laser=System*3, Maser=System*3\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*3, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit)*3, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*3, Neutrino Sensor (10kw)*3, High Pen Densitometer\n(250m)*3, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=10\n      Missile=x04     FusionGun=x06     BeamLaser=xx4\n      Batteries 2                 1                 2\n      Bearing   2                 1                 2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+10\n          Sandcaster=xx4\n          Batteries    2\n          Bearing      2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7*3, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*12, HoloLink*120\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=42 (3 command, 4 bridge, 4 engineer, 5 gunnery, 4 flight,\n21 marines, 1 medical), Staterooms=21, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls,\ngrav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=5426kl (1 Jump-2+15.5 days), Cargo=0, Missile\nMagazine=60kl (100 b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (33hr), Subcraft=2*40t\n(Type 1112 Landing Boats), ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0275_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0275"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":2295.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":405.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":1830.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":5426.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":40.0,"number":2,"notes":"40t\n(Type 1112 Landing Boats)","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":2,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":2,"notes":"FusionGun","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":21,"type":11}]}
