Named for worlds in the Spinward Marches, there\nwas a certain amount of public outcry from the planetary populations so\nrecognized when the class was unveiled, as many didn't think that having such a\nsmall vessel named after their planet was much of an honor.  The Imperial Navy\nstill engages in limited production of Aramis class escorts at shipyards on\nTL13 planets.  When active defenses such as meson screens and dampers (not\nusually installed on vessels in this size class anyway) are not considered,\nthere is not much difference in performance between TL13 and TL15 vessels. The\nmodel 7 computer set up on these vessels is sufficient to be superior to that\ncarried by most small raider and corsair vessels.  Thus, Aramis (and similar)\nclass vessels can be used to perform rear and low threat area escort duties\nenabling more capable ships to be maintained in the front lines.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Aramis Class Light Fleet Escort, TL13, MCr1647.2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>1800\/4500, Disp=2000t, Config=1SL, Armor=55F, Loaded=43524t,\nUnloaded=40692t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>154\/308, Fusion=20700MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>198\/396, Maneuver=4, 90\/180, Jump=4, Cruise=750kph,\nMax=1000kph, Agility=2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2, Laser=System*2, Maser=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*2, EMS Jammer (FarOrbit)*2, EMS\nPassive(Interstellar)*2, Neutrino Sensor (100kw)*2, High Pen Densitometer\n(100m)*2, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff,\nPassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=20\n                 Missile=x05     BeamLaser=xx4\n          Batteries        3                 4\n          Bearing          3                 4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+10\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        4\n          Bearing          4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7fib*3, 1*LargeHoloDisplay, 4*HeadsUpHoloDisplay,\n330*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=30 (4 bridge, 5 engineer, 2 maintenance, 8 gunners, 6\nflight, 4 command, 1 medical), Staterooms=15, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended\nls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=15030kl (1 jump-4+30 days), Cargo=15kl, Missile\nMagazine=180kl (50b-r), Fuel Scoops, Fuel Purifier (24hr), SubCraft=2*50t Wasp\nFighters, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0254_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0254"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":2970.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":1350.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":2310.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":15.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":15030.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":4,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":15,"type":11}]}
