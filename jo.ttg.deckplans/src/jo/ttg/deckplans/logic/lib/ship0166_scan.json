An armored hull provides some resistance to higher\ntech secondary weapons, but at a cost in maneuveribility.  In an effort to\nattain reasonable performance beyond planetary gravity wells, an enormous\nmaneuver drive unit (occupying almost 30% of the total hull volume) is carried,\nwith a correspondingly large power plant.  In normal operation, 21% of power\ncapacity is sufficient to provide 1-G thrust and full life support and sensor\nfunctions, which would allow for up to 73 days of noncombat operations.\nDespite the flaws, the Porcupines are built in large numbers by planets\nunwilling to rely solely on the Imperial navy for defense. Similar vessels can\nbe found in the Sword Worlds planetary fleets and in the Vargr Extents.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Porcupine class SDB, TL10, MCr809.4 (Mass Cost MCr648)\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600t, Config=1AF, Armor=55E, Loaded=21627t,\nUnloaded=21420t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>150\/300, Fusion=13440MW, Duration=15.7 days at full power\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>157\/314, Maneuver=10 (StdGrav=113.1kt), MaxSpeed=3500kph,\nCruise=2625kph, TrueAcc=5.23G (2.6G deepspace), Agility=2 (deepspace)\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System*2, Laser=System*2, Maser=System*2\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(FarOrbit)*2, EMS Passive(Interplanetary)*2,\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassEnScan=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n               Missile=x02   BeamLaser=xx3\n          Batteries      2               2\n          Bearing        2               2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+7\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod4fib*3, 15*HeadsUpDisplay, 1840*DynLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=17 (4 bridge, 5 engineer, 1 maintenance, 4 gunners, 2\ncommand, 1 medical), Staterooms=9, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls,\ninertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=2536kl, Cargo=0, Missile Magazine=60kl (100b-r), Fuel\nScoops, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0166_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0166"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":2349.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":2250.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":2536.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":9,"type":11}]}
