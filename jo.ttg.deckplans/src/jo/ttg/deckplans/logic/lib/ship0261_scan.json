The high cost of heavy spacecraft puts\nthem beyond the reach of almost all mercenary units, and the Lunion government\nshowed little interest in a craft with such diversified capabilities when they\nwere already heavily committed to the production of a specialized fleet escort\nin the same tonnage range.  As a result, only two of these craft had been\nconstructed by 1117--the Triumph and the Victory.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Triumph Class Cruiser, TL13, MCr9801\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>9000\/22500, Disp=10000, Config=1AF, Armor=61F, Loaded=270598t\nUnloaded=261138t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>667\/1333, Fusion=90000MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>720\/1440, Maneuver=3, 360\/720, Jump=3, Cruise=2138kph,\nMax=2850kph, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, Laser=System, Maser=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Planetary), EMS Passive(Substellar), Neutrino Sensor\n(100kw), High Pen Densitometer (100m), ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout,\nPassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=100\n                Missile=x07     BeamLaser=x09       PartAcc=080\n     Batteries           2                 3                3\n     Bearing             2                 3                3\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+6, Nuclear Damper-3\n              SandCaster=x09\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7fib*3, 2*LargeHoloDisplay, 45*HeadsUpHoloDisplay,\n4840*HoloLink\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=289 (11 bridge, 10 medics, 21 engineers, 10 flight, 150\ntroops, 24 maintenance, 13 command, up to 111 additional at full double\noccupancy), Staterooms=200, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates,\ninertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=63000kl, Cargo=4900kl, Missile Magazine=300kl(50b-r), Fuel\nScoops, Fuel Purifier(12hrs), ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0261"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":10800.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":5400.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":10005.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":4900.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":63000.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":1350.0,"number":3,"notes":"PartAcc","type":9},{"volume":54.0,"number":200,"type":11}]}
