The theory of course, is that what works well for larger combatants\nshould work well for smaller ones.  However, several delays in funding had\npushed the projected test date into 1123 by the time that Glisten was overrun\nby the Aslan in 1121.  Only six Shrieks had been built, and they served with\ndistinction racking up twenty three kills of smaller Aslan warships at a loss\nof only one Shriek.  The five surviving boats were evacuated aboard a\nLobachevsky class fleet tender during the Imperial Glisten Navy's final retreat\nfrom the system around 110-1121, and are currently (1122) defending the\nnow-strategic starport in the Grote system.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Shriek class Missile Boat, TL15, MCr464.9\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>720\/1800, Disp=800, Config=1AF, Armor=40G, Unloaded=7921t,\nLoaded=8512t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>42\/84, Fusion=11160MW, Dur=53.8 days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>123\/246, Maneuver=6, NOE=190kph, Cruise=3150kph, Max=4200kph,\nTrueAcc=10.38G, Agility=10\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, LaserComm=System, MaserComm=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(Far Orbit), EMS Jammer(Far Orbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar), High Pen Densitometer(1km), Neutrino Sensor(10kw),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=8\n          BeamLaser=xx4      Missile=x06\n          Batteries   1                1\n          Bearing     1                1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+20\n          Sandcaster=xx4\n          Batteries    1\n          Bearing      1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod9*3, HeadsUpHoloDisplay*2, HoloLink*50\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=4 (1 bridge, 1 engineer, 2 gunnery), Staterooms=4,\nEnv=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=7210kl, Cargo=0, Missile Magazine=180kl (100b-r), Fuel\nScoops, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Faint Note: For full MT compatibility, consider\nacceleration to be 6-Gs, agility 0, and DefDM+10.<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0314_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0314"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":1836.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":630.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":7210.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":6,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":4,"type":11}]}
