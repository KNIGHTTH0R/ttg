Only\nthree have been constructed as of 1-1117 (Yataghan, Tulwar, and Kukri). While\noriginally conceived of as high agility vessels, their substantial weight of\narmor tends to make them sluggish.  Work on additional vessels of the class has\nbeen suspended while BuShip considers a redesign effort.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Yataghan Class Missile Boat, TL15, MCr 7673\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>5400\/13500, Disp=6000, Config=1AF, Armor=67G, Loaded=145,804t,\nUnloaded=136,244t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>267\/534, Fusion=72000MW, Dur=30 days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>216\/432, Jump 3, 756\/1512, Maneuver=5 (Thrusters=546kt),\nNOE=140kph, Cruise=2592kph, Max=3456kph, TrueAcc=3.75G, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, LaserComm=System, MaserComm=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Far Orbit), EMS Jammer(Far Orbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar), High Pen Densitometer(1km), Neutrino Sensor(10kw),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=60\n       BeamLaser=xx9           Missile=x90\n      Batteries   1                    4\n      Bearing     1                    4\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+10, Nuclear Damper-9, Meson Screen-9\n          Sandcaster=xx9\n          Batteries    1\n          Bearing      1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod9fib*3, LargeHoloDisplay*2, HeadsUpDisplay*30,\nHoloLink*210\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=117 (12 Command, 12 bridge, 7 engineer, 24 gunnery, 10\nflight, 40 troops, 2 medical), Staterooms=65, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended\nls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=42120kl (3120t), Cargo=5270kl (390t), Fuel Scoops, Fuel\nPurifier (12hr), Subcraft=3 Pinnaces, ObjSize=Large, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0327"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":11340.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":3240.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":4005.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":5270.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":42120.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":540.0,"number":3,"notes":"Pinnaces","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":675.0,"number":4,"notes":"Missile","type":9},{"volume":13.5,"number":10,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":65,"type":11}]}
