As much of the outward\nappearance of the original vessel was retained as possible.  Major changes were\nmade to the control and sensor systems (upgraded to a Model 7 computer, which\nresulted in a reduction in the required operating crew to two men), and the\ncargo\/living spaces, which were reconfigured into a launch\/service bay for six\nRaptor class landers and accommodations for 78 crewpersons.  The cost given\nbelow includes the price of the landers. Power allocation is such that the\nlasers cannot be operated at the same time as the grav plates and the inertial\ncompensators.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Admiral Bertil, TL13, MCr606.8\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600, Config=4SL, Armor=40F, Loaded=10625t,\nUnloaded=3912t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>14\/28, Fusion=1800MW, Duration=30days\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>11\/22, Maneuver=1, 22\/44, Jump=3, NOE=40kph, Cruise=750kph,\nMax=1000kph, Agility=1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, Laser=System, Maser=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMS Active(Planetary), EMS Passive(Substellar), Neutrino Sensor\n(100kw), High Pen Densitometer (100m), ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout,\nPassObjScan=Diff, PassObjPin=Diff, PassEnScan=Rout, PassEnPin=Diff\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n              Missile=x03     BeamLaser=x04\n          Batteries     3                 1\n          Bearing       3                 1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDM+9\n              SandCaster=x04\n          Batteries        2\n          Bearing          2\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod7*3, 2*HeadsUpHoloDisplay\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=78 (1 bridge, 2 medic, 1 engineer, 24 flight, 48 troops, 2\ncommand), Staterooms=39, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates,\ninertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=2340kl, Cargo=417kl (30.8t), Missile Magazine=45kl\n(90b-r), Fuel Scoops, ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Moderate<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0245_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0245"},"configuration":4,"items":[{"volume":162.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":324.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":210.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":417.0,"number":0,"type":7},{"volume":2340.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":39,"type":11}]}
