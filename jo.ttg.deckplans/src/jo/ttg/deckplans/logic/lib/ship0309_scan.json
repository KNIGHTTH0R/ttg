It was also one of the first\nships designed by the IGN after the high power density TL15 fusion plants\nbecame available, and as such was something of an experimental design. The\nprovision of a battery of high energy weapons was required by BuShip, along\nwith a model 9 computer.  The latter reduces crew requirements substantially,\nand is considered to be one of the few positive features of the design. Since\nthe power plant is only required to meet peak performance during combat, the\nendurance of the vessel can be increased to 26 days when operating without\nweapon use or extended acceleration over 1G.  This policy of tradeoffs in the\ndesign also led to the unfortunate side effect of the vessel having\ninsufficient power to operate the inertial compensators at accelerations of\nover 2Gs. The Shambalators are dependent on o<P>\n\nutside fuel purification capability.  Despite these flaws, 600 were initially\nbuilt, and performed adequately in the Fifth Frontier War.  About 450 remain in\nactive service with the IGN. As of 1117, an additional 30 had been transferred\nto the Glisten Patrol and Revenue Service.  The price given below includes the\ntwo Stinger class light fighters.  PARS vessels do not carry fighters,\nreplacing them with a small utility craft such as the ConTech minilaunch.<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<TABLE border=1>\n\n<TR><TD>CraftID:\n<TD>Shambalator class Escort, TL15, MCr443\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Hull:\n<TD>540\/1350, Disp=600, Config=1AF, Armor=49G, Unloaded=5132t,\nLoaded=5669t\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Power:\n<TD>15\/30, Fusion=3960MW, Dur=9.5\/28.5\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Loco:\n<TD>17\/34, Jump 2, 44\/88, Maneuver=3 (Thrusters=31200t),\nTrueAcc=5.5G, NOE=190kph, Cruise=2730kph, Max=3640kph, Agility=0\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Comm:\n<TD>Radio=System, LaserComm=System, MaserComm=System\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Sensors:\n<TD>EMM EMS Active(Far Orbit), EMS Jammer(Far Orbit), EMS\nPassive(Interstellar), High Pen Densitometer(1km), Neutrino Sensor(10kw),\nActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PassObjScan=Rout, PassObjPin=Rout,\nPassEnScan=Simp, PassEnPin=Rout\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Off:\n<TD><PRE>Hardpoints=6\n      BeamLaser=xx4      Missile=x03    PartAcc=002\n      Batteries   2                1              1\n      Bearing     2                1              1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Def:\n<TD><PRE>DefDm+10\n          Sandcaster=xx4\n          Batteries    1\n          Bearing      1\n<\/PRE><\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Control:\n<TD>Computer Mod9*3, LargeHoloDisplay*1\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Accom:\n<TD>Crew=8 (1 Command, 1 bridge, 1 engineer, 1 gunnery, 4 flight),\nStaterooms=7, Env=basic env, basic ls, extended ls, grav plates, inertial comp\n<\/TR>\n\n<TR><TD>Other:\n<TD>Fuel=5776kl (427t), Cargo=0, Missile Magazine=6kl (60 missiles,\n20 battery rounds), Fuel Scoops, Subcraft=2 Stinger class Fighters ObjSize=Avg,\nEmLevel=Faint<\/TABLE>\n<P>\n\n<P>\n\n<IMG src=\"ship0309_00.png\"\/>\n<P>\nAuthor: R.S.Dean\n<\/BODY>\n<\/HTML>\n","dir":"d:\\temp\\data\\ship\\deanfiles","baseName":"ship0309"},"configuration":1,"items":[{"volume":648.0,"number":0,"type":2},{"volume":243.0,"number":0,"type":3},{"volume":225.0,"number":0,"type":4},{"volume":5776.0,"number":0,"type":5},{"volume":81.0,"number":2,"notes":"Stinger class Fighters","type":8},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"BeamLaser","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"Missile","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":1,"notes":"SandCaster","type":6},{"volume":13.5,"number":0,"notes":"PartAcc","type":6},{"volume":54.0,"number":7,"type":11}]}
